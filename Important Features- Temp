Basic properties of sound: Frequency, Amplitude
  Derived from above: Loudness(Power), Harmonics- {fundamental freq+ Overtones, Octaves, Notes(~Raaga-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raga)}

Human Perception: Pitch,Timbre
  Pitch - we can roughly use frequency or use Mel Cepstrum (~ IFT(log(FT(Mel))) )
  Timbre ???
 
 Extra statistics: Kurtosis, Variance etc.
